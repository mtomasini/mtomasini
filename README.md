👋 Hi, I’m Matteo (he/him/his), a research engineer at the University of Gothenburg. I develop agent-based simulations and other computational solutions in digital humanities, with a particular accent on archaeology but not only. Among my many tasks, I model Bronze Age navigation in the [Maritime Encounters project](https://www.gu.se/en/research/maritime-encounters) and help maintain and develop the [backend](https://github.com/gu-gridh/diana-backend) of our in-house scientific portal. I'm also an application expert at [InfraVis](https://infravis.se/). Additionally, I am the chair of the board of [Nordic-RSE](https://nordic-rse.org/), an association dedicated to the advancement of careers of research software engineers in the Nordics.


- 👀 I’m especially interested in developing models in archaeology, but my toolbox is broad and I'm collaborating on projects that span from sound analysis to visualization of multi-dimensional data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement typical software development pipelines, in order to better integrate my team. In parallel, I am constantly improving my archaeological training.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in archaeology! If you think agent-based modelling might help you, come to me!
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Bluesky (@mattomasini.bsky.social) or Mastodon (@mattomasini@mas.to)! And if you're not a bot, you will have no problems finding my institutional e-mail on my webpage.
