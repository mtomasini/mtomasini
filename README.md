- 👋 Hi, I’m Matteo, a research engineer at the University of Gothenburg. I develop agent-based simulations and other computational solutions in digital humanities.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software for non-stereotypical projects, such as in archaeology or litterature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement typical software development pipelines, in order to better integrate my team.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the humanities! If you think agent-based modelling might help you, come to me!
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Twitter (@mattomasini) or Mastodon (@mattomasini@mas.to)! And if you're not a bot, you will have no problems finding my institutional e-mail on my webpage.
