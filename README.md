- 👋 Hi, I’m Matteo, a research engineer at the University of Gothenburg. After almost a decade of work in theoretical evolutionary biology, I am about to start developing simulations and software in Digital Humanities.
- 👀 I’m interested in helping researchers to harness the power of computational methods. Also, open source software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be of help! I'm only now starting in this field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of interesting projects: I am passionate by knowledge and I would like to work in history, litterature, philosophy,...  
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Twitter (@mattomasini)! And if you're not a bot, you will have no problems finding my institutional e-mail on my webpage.
